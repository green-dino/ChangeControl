-   The presence of Security Architects (SEC-ARCH) in the Active Directory ensures the cultivation of knowledgeable teams and the promotion of a security-first culture. This helps in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
-   Systems Architects (SYS-ARCH) streamline workflows and evolve a unified operating model, ensuring that security measures are integrated throughout the system development lifecycle. This reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities during system design and implementation.
-   Software Developers (SOFT-DEV) collaborate effectively across the platform, emphasizing secure coding practices and incorporating security measures into applications. This reduces the potential for exploitable software vulnerabilities.
-   Data Architects (DATA-ARCH) ensure efficient and effective data management, including proper classification, protection, and access controls. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access or data breaches.
-   Enterprise Architects (ENT-ARCH) align business objectives with hybrid cloud operations, facilitating the implementation of robust security controls and monitoring mechanisms across the entire infrastructure.
-   The framework also includes various other roles such as Cyber Defense Analysts (CYBER-ANALYST), Cyber Defense Infrastructure Support (CYBER-INFRA), and Security Control Assessors (SEC-ASSESSOR) who analyze operational security challenges, support and secure the hybrid cloud infrastructure, and assess and implement security controls, respectively.
-   The relationship mapping highlights the importance of various knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required for each role, emphasizing the need for a well-rounded understanding of security practices and risk management.

By incorporating these roles and their associated responsibilities, the framework establishes a strong foundation for a secure and resilient operational environment. It fosters proactive identification and mitigation of security risks, promotes adherence to best practices, and enables effective incident response and resolution. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach reduces the likelihood and impact of data breaches and cyber attacks, enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
